      <h2 style="text-align:center;">WHY TWITCH?</h2>

      <p>So why Twitch, over all the other available streaming services online, like Youtube? The reasoning lies in the immersive quality of the streaming experience. Watchers of content have always loved the possibility of being incorporated into the things that they watch, and one of the joys of Twitch lies in giving the watchers that opportunity to communicate with their favorite streamers. The layout of the site allows users to follow the commentary of other viewers of the stream in the chat, while simultaneously the streamer can react and respond to comments sent by their viewers in real time. Twitch’s layout ensures that the hierarchy of the page puts just as much value into the chat bar as it does the stream itself, allowing it to take up at least a quarter of the viewing grid. Additionally, Twitch ensures that copyrighted music used in streams is edited out of past broadcasts, so streamers aren’t faced with infringement. Recently, Youtube has attempted to turn to increase its streaming content and quality to keep with the times, but since it remains mainly a site containing pre-posted video content, its layout isn’t nearly as efficient as Twitch’s, which is purely focused on streaming.

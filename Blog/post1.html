      <img src="#" alt="Creator Page">
      <p>Twitch.tv's layout for a creator profile is composed of three main segments: the page’s avatar and cover image, its video player banner, and its info panels.
The avatar and cover image are the first thing seen on a given creator’s page. An avatar is simply a small image used as the overall branding of the streamer. The cover image is a 1200x380px picture that displays at the top of a creator’s page. Neither the avatar image nor the cover banner can contain more than 3MB of data.
A video player banner is displayed when a creator is not online. It can be utilized as branding, scheduling, or a simple information page for interested viewers. The image used for the video player banner is generally recommended to be 1920x1080px, and must also be under 3MB in size.
Info panels are the “personal columns” of a creator’s page, and act much like a blurb on the back of a book intended to convince a person to get involved would. The panels can be moved and rearranged freely, and are generally used to display social media contacts, scheduling, or general overviews of who the streamer is and what they do on stream.
